Prepare a jupyter notebook (recommended - Google Colab) to build, train and evaluate a Machine/ Deep Learning model on the given dataset. Please read the instructions carefully.

Part A 
Dataset - http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html 
The motive of the assignment is to identify whether a person is wearing Eyeglasses, wearing a hat and has a mustache or not. CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations. The images in this dataset cover large pose variations and background clutter. CelebA has large diversities, large quantities, and rich annotations, including
-	10,177 number of identities,
-	202,599 number of face images, and
-	5 landmark locations, 40 binary attributes annotations per image.

1.	Import Libraries/Dataset 
a.	Download the dataset
b.	Import the required libraries

2.	Data Visualization and Exploration
a.	Print at least 5 rows for sanity check to identify all the features present in the dataset and if the target matches with them.
b.	Print the description and shape of the dataset.
c.	Provide appropriate visualization to get an insight about the dataset.
d.	Try exploring the data and see what insights can be drawn from the dataset.

3.	Data Pre-processing and cleaning
a.	Do the appropriate preprocessing of the data like Use image augmentation if needed.
b.	Apply the feature transformation techniques like Standardization, Normalization, etc. You are free to apply the appropriate transformations depending upon the structure and the complexity of your dataset.
c.	Do the correlational analysis on the dataset. Provide a visualization for the same.

4.	Data Preparation
a.	Do the final feature selection and extract them into Column X and the class label into Column into Y.
b.	Split the dataset into training and test sets.

Part B 
1.	Model Building
a.	Perform Model Development using at least three models, separately. You are free to apply any Machine/Deep Learning Models on the dataset. 
b.	 Train the model and print the training accuracy and loss values.

2.	Performance Evaluation
a.	Print the confusion matrix. Provide appropriate analysis for the same.
b.	Do the prediction for the test data and display the results for the inference.
